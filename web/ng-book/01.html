Instead of merging data into a template and replacing a DOM element, AngularJS creates live templates as a view Every time there could be a potential change, Angular will do a dirty check inside its event loop (discussed in depth in the under the hood chapter) to ensure everything is consistent.Bi-directional in this context means that if the view changes the value, the model observes the change through dirty checking, and if the model changes the value, the view update with the change.-->
